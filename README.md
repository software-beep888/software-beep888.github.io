def about_me():
    return {
        "focus": "Turning raw data into business impact",
        "style": ["clean code", "reproducible analysis", "data storytelling"],
        "tools": ["Python", "SQL", "Pandas", "PostgreSQL", "Matplotlib", "Jupyter", "dbt", "Power BI"],

    }
🎯 Key Strengths
End-to-end analytics pipelines – ETL → modeling → reporting → automation

SQL-heavy analytical problem solving – complex queries, optimization, window functions

Reproducible, production-style project structure – every project is documented and runnable

Business-focused reporting – executive summaries, dashboards (Power BI, Matplotlib), PDF/Excel outputs

Analytics engineering workflows – dbt, data modeling, testing, documentation

📂 Portfolio Structure
Each project follows a consistent, professional structure:

📁 /data – Cleaned datasets or scripts to generate them
📁 /scripts – Python ETL, cleaning, statistical tests
📁 /sql – Queries for extraction & transformation
📁 /outputs – Dashboards (Power BI / Matplotlib), PDFs, Excel files
📄 README.md – Executive summary, approach, insights, reproduction guide

This structure ensures reproducibility, clarity, and business‑readiness.
